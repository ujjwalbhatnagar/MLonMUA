pc01 = 2001 Indian Population Census
ec98 = 1998 Economic Census
ec05 = 2005 Economic Census
emp  = employment
vd   = village directory (village amenities/public goods table)
pca  = population census abstract (demographic data)

Note that the pc01_*_id variables are ID variables that can be used to identify villages and districts. 

You can find more information about the fields online, but we don't recommend you do so, because it takes a lot of time to get the right information (and it's not necessary for this exercise). If you need help understanding the coding of a variable, you can just make an educated assumption about what it means and tell us what you assumed - we're looking for your reasoning behind the choices you make, and your ability to communicate that reasoning.

This is a merged dataset that combines several rounds of administrative data collected by the Indian government, collapsed to the village and town level. The fields represent village aggregates and have been minimally cleaned. For this exercise, we are most interested in village public services (often represented with binary measures), demographics (like population), and employment, as well as administrative data on recent road construction.
